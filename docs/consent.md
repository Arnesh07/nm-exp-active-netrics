Summary
-------

BISmark collects measurements of your ISP's network and the performance of your
Internet service based on traffic and requests generated by the BISmark
software (active measurements). **BISmark does not collect information from
your network traffic.** The BISmark team collects information about your
location and your Internet service, as well as your contact information, as
part of the enrollment process. Information about your Internet service,
location, and BISmark performance measurements will be used to present an
online report of your network performance, and to conduct research related to
home network and broadband Internet performance. Your contact information will
be retained for the duration of your participation in the study.

Full Statement
--------------

This statement describes the information collected as part of your
participation in BISmark, as well as how this information is used, disclosed,
and retained. This statement does not attempt to characterize the risks of
collecting or storing the information, or the disclosure of this information as
described below. You must assess and accept the risks of participating in

### Information we collect, and how we use it

We collect three types of information, for the following purposes:

- **Participant Information** is collected as part of the enrollment process. This
  information will be used to maintain contact with participants for the
  duration of the BISmark study.
- **Service Information** is also collected as part of the enrollment process. This
  information will be used for research, analysis, and evaluation of broadband
  Internet service performance.
- **Active Measurement Information** is collected by the BISmark home gateway
  device provided to participants for the duration of their participation in
  the BISmark study. This information will be used for research, analysis, and
  evaluation of broadband Internet service performance. Active Measurement
  Information is collected only from active measurements generated by the
  BISmark measurement device. Network traffic generated by the participant is
  not measured or observed.


Specific examples of information collected in each of these categories is given
below:

**Participant Information**

- name
- email address
- telephone number

**Service Information**

- broadband Internet service provider
- broadband Internet service termination location (e.g. street address,
  town/city, state/province, country)
- broadband Internet service specifications (e.g. access technology, promised
  upload and download rates, data transfer caps, etc.)

**Active Measurement Information**

- throughput (speed) from the gateway to measurement servers
- latency (ping time) from the gateway to Internet locations
- DNS resolution via ISP DNS server
- ISP network topology & network management behavior
- gateway WAN interface IP address, likely your ISP-provided public IP address

To control the measurement experiments run on participants' BISmark devices, as
well as to upgrade and troubleshoot devices when they are installed in
participants' homes, the BISmark routers have remote access capabilities.
Authorized members of the BISmark team have the capability to execute scripts
and obtain shell access on the BISmark router installed in your home. These
capabilities will only be used for controlling measurement scripts and for
performing maintenance on your BISmark router.


Privacy Statement
=================

Summary
-------

BISmark-Passive collects limited information about how and when devices on your
home network access the Internet. Specifically, it collects information about
the devices connected to your home network, the type and amount of network
traffic transferred by these devices, the domain names of popular Internet sites
accessed by these devices, and the frequency of such access.  **BISmark-Passive
never inspects or captures the application-level contents of your network traffic.**

Full Statement
--------------

This statement describes the information collected as part of your participation
in BISmark-Passive, as well as how this information is used, disclosed, and
retained. This statement does not attempt to characterize the risks of
collecting or storing the information, or the disclosure of this information as
described below. You must assess and accept the risks of participating in
BISmark-Passive before you agree to participate in the BISmark-Passive study.

Information we **do not** collect
---------------------------------

- **BISmark-Passive does not record URLs.** For popular Web sites, we only
  record the domain name of the Web site. For example, if you watch a video on
  YouTube, we will record the fact that you visited www.youtube.com, but not the
  specific URL of the video, which would indicate the video you watched.
- **BISmark-Passive does not record Personally Identifiable Information (PII).**
  We do not record your name, e-mail address, mailing address, MAC addresses or
  IP addresses except as described above and in the BISmark Privacy Statement.
  We never request or record financial information, social security numbers,
  birth dates, etc.
- **BISmark-Passive does not record application packet contents.** We do not
  monitor the contents of e-mails, chat conversations, phone calls, file
  downloads, Web page contents, Internet login credentials, or anything else
  about your online activities except as described above.

BISmark-Passive is installed on your BISmark router and does not affect or
install software on any of your personal network devices.

Information we collect, and why we collect it
---------------------------------------------

BISmark-Passive collects the following types of information about every device
that accesses the Internet using your BISmark router:

- BISmark-Passive records the manufacturer of each network device that accesses
  the Internet using your BISmark router by recording the first 3 bytes of each
  device's hardware identifier (MAC address). We use this information to
  differentiate between classes of devices (e.g. a video game console vs. a
  desktop computer).
- BISmark-Passive counts the number of times your devices communicate with
  popular Internet domains and subdomains. For example, if you visit
  http://maps.google.com, we will record `maps.google.com`, because
  `google.com` is on the list of popular domains. We collect this information to
  understand the frequency with which people access popular Internet sites. The
  set of domains that are monitored is based on the Alexa "Top Sites" list
  (http://www.alexa.com/topsites), and you can alter this list of monitored
  domains, or completely disable this collection activity.
- BISmark-Passive records the types of network applications your devices use,
  and how frequently each application is used, by recording the quantity of
  network traffic associated with each TCP or UDP port number. We collect this
  information to understand the types of applications people commonly use from
  their home network. Examples of network applications include Web browsing,
  e-mail, instant messaging, and Skype.
- BISmark-Passive collects information about the distribution of network traffic
  by recording the size of each unit of information (packet) transmitted through
  your BISmark router, as well as the date and time at which the transmission
  occured. We collect this information to understand what an "average" home
  network traffic distribution looks like.

Although we believe it is unlikely, information collected by BISmark-Passive
could potentially be used to identify you in certain circumstances. You must
assess and accept the risks of participating in BISmark-Passive before you agree
to participate in the study.

Examples of information collected by BISmark-Passive
----------------------------------------------------

The following examples illustrate the types of information collected in
different BISmark-Passive usage scenarios related to watching a video on
YouTube:

- **Watching a YouTube video on your laptop while it is *not* connected to your
  BISmark router.** BISmark-Passive will not record any information in this case
  because it only monitors network activity through your BISmark router.
- **Watching a YouTube video on your laptop while it is connected to your
  BISmark router.** BISmark-Passive will record:
    - the fact that you visited youtube.com, because YouTube is on the list of
      popular sites,
    - the amount of data of transferred to and from your laptop, including the
      size and timestamp of each packet transferred,
    - the fact that the data transferred to and from your your laptop occured
      via a Web browser (TCP ports 53, 80, and 443), and
    - the manufacturer of your laptop's network card.
- **Watching a YouTube video on your laptop after removing youtube.com from the
  list of popular sites.** Now BISmark-Passive will not record the fact that you
  visited YouTube. BISmark-passive will still record other general information
  about this activity:
    - the amount of data of transferred to and from your laptop, including the
      size and timestamp of each packet transferred,
    - the fact that the data transferred to and from your your laptop occured
      via a Web browser (TCP ports 53, 80, and 443), and
    - the manufacturer of your laptop's network card.
- **Visiting a subdomain of a popular site.** Suppose you read a blog post at
  http://yourfriendsblog.blogspot.com/posts/my-first-post. If you haven't
  removed Blogspot from the list of popular sites then BISmark-Passive will
  record the fact that you visited `yourfriendsblog.blogspot.com` (not just
  `blogspot.com` and not the full URL.)

Information disclosure
----------------------

All of the information described above will be collected, maintained, and used
by the BISmark-Passive team. We may disclose this information outside of the
BISmark-Passive team in the following ways:
- The BISmark-Passive team will utilize the collected data to produce scholarly
  works such as articles, reports, and presentations that will be published and
  publicly accessible. These results will typically contain aggregated and
  derivative information, but may contain raw information, excluding PII as
  noted in the BISmark Privacy Statement.
- Any information collected as part of BISmark-Passive may potentially be
  disclosed in response to a lawful request by law enforcement or other legal
  processes or authorities.
